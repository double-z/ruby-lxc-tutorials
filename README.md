### Ruby-LXC Tutorials

A collection of tutorials on using [lxc](http://linuxcontainers.org/) with [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language.

### Description
Hello, this is a repository containing a collection of tutorials and associated scripts on LXC (using ruby). 
If you are dont know what is a container, start with the first tutorial. If you already know about LXC and have an existing LXC setup, you can skip to the third section. Section four an five provides some core lxc api, which will be used in later sections. Section six and onwards are topic specific, and you can choose the ones that are relevent to you (or all if you just want to explore them).

Before you start, note that bulk of this documentation and code is experimental. Currently LXC 1.0 is in beta, you should wait until April, for Ubuntu 14.04 release, around which lxc 1.0 will be released. ruby-lxc GA release is also expected to be during the same timeline. Till then things can change a bit (but not a lot).
